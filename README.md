# jEvidence - SHOW RESULTS OF TESTS EXECUTIONS IN A MODERN & CLEAR WAY

jEvidence allows you to present tests executions as a web page in a much clearer way than the existing solutions.

Key features:

* Tests trend : Check how many tests have been added and how their status has been changed
* Statistics : Check how execution duration and average test duration have been changed
* Performance : Compare two executions and check time differences between them
* Testing frameworks : jEvidence supports jUnit and testNG frameworks
* Logging frameworks : jEvidence supports java.util.logging.Logger and log4j frameworks. Each log of these frameworks is saved as test step
* 
Current version: 1.1
